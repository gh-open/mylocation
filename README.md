## MyLocation Library

An Android library that wraps the common, repeatable building blocks required for continuous location tracking apps:

- Listen to Android location updates (e.g. Fused / GPS / Network providers) behind a clean API surface.
- Persist recorded location samples into local storage for later processing / upload.
- Run all tracking logic inside a resilient Android foreground service to keep the process alive while respecting platform limits.

Instead of re‑implementing these core pieces in every project, this repository packages them as reusable modules you can embed in your own apps.


### What This Project Aims To Provide

| Concern | Goal |
|---------|------|
| Acquisition | Consistent stream of high‑quality location updates with pluggable provider strategy. |
| Reliability | Foreground service + lifecycle aware components keep tracking active. |
| Storage | Local persistence (e.g. database / file) for durable, queryable history. |
| Abstraction | Simple façade so app code asks for "startTracking() / stopTracking()" without managing low‑level Android APIs. |
| Extensibility | Hooks for filtering, batching, enrichment (speed, distance, accuracy heuristics). |

### Core Concepts

- Foreground Service: Ensures ongoing tracking under modern Android background execution limits; surfaces a persistent notification.
- Location Stream: Unified flow of location samples (time, lat, lon, accuracy, speed, bearing, source).
- Local Storage Layer: Abstract interface allowing different persistence implementations (e.g. Room database, file, queue). The concrete implementation can be swapped without changing callers.
- Recording Policy: Strategy governing desired update interval, priority, accuracy vs. power trade‑offs.

### Privacy & Responsibility

Location data stays **on-device**: no automatic uploads, no embedded third‑party SDK calls. Storage is local and fully under your control (retention, export, encryption choices). Add any network transfer only in your own app layer with clear user disclosure.

### Contributing

Issues & PRs for optimizations, new provider abstractions, and documentation improvements are welcome. Please keep changes modular and documented.
